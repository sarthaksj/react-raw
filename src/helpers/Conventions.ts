      "When I started frontend development it was very difficult for me to build components like Modal, Dropdowns, Toasts etc. Open source was an option but there I didn't get full control over the components regarding JavaScript and Styles. So I decided to build react-raw as a collection of raw components that I would use for my projects regularly. Dropdowns, Modals and etc are all the essential components of the UI that we as developers need for our projects on a day to day basis, since creating them again and again is repetitive task and react-raw is an attempt to help you to build components as quickly as you can. I hope this proves as useful to you as it is to me.";
